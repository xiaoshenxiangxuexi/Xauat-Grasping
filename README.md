# Xauat-Grasping
Xauat-grasping is a grasp detection challenge dataset.

We built a single-target grasping dataset called Xauat-Grasping, which covers regular objects and some challenging objects such as transparent untextured objects, non-transparent untextured objects, and deformable objects. The Xauat-Grasping grasping dataset contains a total of 727 samples for 281 different objects, and the size of each sample is 640×480. Among them, regular objects account for 53.5% of the total number of samples, while challenging objects account for 46.5%. We have added 160 new multi-target grab samples and labelled files.

This video demonstrates the robotic grasping operation from our paper. During actual execution, the robot's motion speed was deliberately set to a low level in the laboratory environment to ensure safety and reliability throughout the grasping process. For clearer observation of manipulation details, the playback speed has been accelerated.
