# Xauat-Grasping
Xauat-grasping is a grasp detection challenge dataset.

We built a single-target grasping dataset called Xauat-Grasping, which covers regular objects and some challenging objects such as transparent untextured objects, non-transparent untextured objects, and deformable objects. The Xauat-Grasping grasping dataset contains a total of 727 samples for 281 different objects, and the size of each sample is 640Ã—480. Among them, regular objects account for 53.5% of the total number of samples, while challenging objects account for 46.5%.
